# Customer Churn Prediction

In this project, I built a machine learning model to predict customer churn using a telecom dataset.

## Tools Used
- Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn
- Logistic Regression, Random Forest
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Key Insights
- High tenure and contract type significantly affect churn probability.
- Monthly charges were highly correlated with churn rate.
